Here is some sample text. <a href='#Node' title='Node'>Node</a> is one of my keywords and so is <a href='#AudioNode' title='AudioNode'>AudioNode</a>. already has a link and shouldn't be duplicated. <a href='#Node' title='Node'>Node</a> should not override <a href='#AudioNode' title='AudioNode'>AudioNode</a>. And if I use <a href='#Node' title='Node'>Node</a> as part of another word like CrazyNode, it shouldn't change it. Also want to make sure it works at the end of a tag <a href='#Node' title='Node'>Node</a>
