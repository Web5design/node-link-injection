Here is some sample text. Node is one of my keywords and so is AudioNode. already has a link and shouldn't be duplicated. Node should not override AudioNode. And if I use Node as part of another word like CrazyNode, it shouldn't change it. <a href='#'>this is <p>going to be<p>a stupid nested AudioNode</p> that shouldn't parse</p> because its in an anchor</a>. Also want to make sure it works at the end of a tag Node
